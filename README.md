# Final project for medical electronics lab

### Description

- In this project I'am developing a device able to recognize speech commads and act on them.

- This is a demo project, its main parts are:
  - Build a neural network model for recognizing speech commands
  - Upload the neural network to a microcontroller
  - Build application on the microcontroller for recording speech data and running the neural network on them
  - Design the circut for the microcontroller, this will be just a microphone and few LEDs
  
Update 10.1.2023
- It does not work, the signal from the microphone is different to the signal the neural net was trained on so the predictions are not stable.
